## What this paper argues (in one breath)
When a KPI becomes **a performance target**, **an incentive lever**, and **a machine-learning label** at the same time, it stops behaving like a neutral measurement. Under AI acceleration, this creates a reinforcing loop where proxy metrics improve while durable customer outcomes quietly degrade. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This paper proposes a control layer—**Trust Signal Health**—to detect and constrain that drift before it becomes systemic. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## The core diagnosis: KPI Self-Reinforcement Drift
Modern call centers increasingly operate as a closed loop:

**Proxy KPI → Incentive pressure → Behavior shifts → Proxy-based labels → Model retraining → Recommendations → More proxy optimization**

The scarier part is that nobody has to “cheat.” The architecture does it by itself once the feedback loop gets fast enough. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## The proposed solution: an integrity control layer
This paper introduces governance signals designed to sit *next to* performance KPIs—not replace them.

**Performance dashboards optimize. Integrity signals constrain.** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Governance signals defined
- **DAR — Delayed Adverse Rate**: instability after “successful” interactions :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **DRL — Downstream Remediation Load**: drift in post-success workload distribution :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **DOV — Durable Outcome Validation**: decay in predictive validity over time :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **POR — Proxy Overfit Ratio**: proxy improvement outpacing durable outcome improvement :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **TER — Terminal Exit Rate**: terminal exits following “success” (listed in abstract as a governance signal) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **SII — System Integrity Index**: weighted composite integrity constraint (with optional gating) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

**Key point:** **SII is not a performance score.** It’s a *velocity regulator*—a veto condition when KPI acceleration is no longer aligned with durable outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Why this matters beyond call centers
This isn’t “a telecom thing.” It’s an **architecture thing**.

Any environment where a metric is simultaneously:
- a compensation driver,
- a ranking input,
- a dashboard target,
- and a machine-learning label,

…is vulnerable to the same distortion pattern. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
